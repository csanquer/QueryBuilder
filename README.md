SQLQueryBuilder
===============

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/csanquer/QueryBuilder.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/csanquer/QueryBuilder)

Classes used to build programmatically standard SQL Queries (with some MySQL
specific functions). These classes must be used with PDO and parameters are always
bound .

Based on original work by Justin Stayton [https://github.com/jstayton/QueryBuilder](https://github.com/jstayton/QueryBuilder)
And some classes from Propel ORM project [https://github.com/jstayton/QueryBuilder](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel) .
